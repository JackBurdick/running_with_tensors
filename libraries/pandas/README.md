# Pandas

From the [documenation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html):

```text
"package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language"
```

## Basics

The primary data structures in pandas are either:

- Series (1-dimensional): a single column

  - [Series Notebooks](./series/)

- DataFrame (2-dimensional): similar to a relational data table (rows, columns)

  - [DataFrame Notebooks](./dataframe/)

## Index

**TODO**: this will contain links to relevant notebooks for commonly used+searched for functionality
