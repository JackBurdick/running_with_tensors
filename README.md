# Teaching a Computer to Fish

This project is a collection of my experiences and lessons I have attended/read/etc.

In theory, I aim to ultimately publish a ``book'' on the subject of machine learning (with an emphasis on neural networks). In practice, it may never be complete/published and may only appear as a series of blog posts.

Additionally, this project creates a guide for me to follow to implement features in my other project [YeahML](https://github.com/JackBurdick/YeahML). a machine learning library that primarily opperates on config files.
