## Running with Tensors

Much like running with scissors, running with tensors is _dangerous_.  I am not an expert, nor do I claim to be. This is an incomplete and incomprehensive guide to using tensorflow + common (related) ml libraries in python.  This is largely for personal use, but I do hope that I can help alleviate some of the pain of DL/TF growing pains for someone else.

#### plan
> This project serves two main purposes; 1) personal use 2) I wanted to create "the guide I wish I would've found" when I started. Eventually, I intend to turn these into a blog/(maybe youtube) series.
