\chapter{Prerequisites}

\textcolor{blue}{The following sections are a non-exhaustive, brief, refresher on some of the important underlying concepts and methodologies used by later concepts. Resources to further explore and learn these concepts are shared.}


\section{Math Notation}

\textcolor{blue}{Depending on the resource, the level of formal math education required to understand a passage may vary greatly. In order to demystify some of the resources that do not expand on the proofs and notations, below are some of the symbols and XXXXX used in math notation and their interpretation in simple text/natural language form.}

\textcolor{green}{TODO: Show symbols and examples in both equation and simple text/natural language form.}
