\section{Partitioning Data}

\textcolor{blue}{Ideally, a model will generalize well i.e. a model will perform well on data that it has never seen. When evaluating a model, the performance is reported on a data that has never been seen by the model. When a dataset is obtained, one of the first steps performed is to partition the dataset -- a portion of the dataset is removed and placed aside as the ``test'' set that will later be used to measure the performance of an indicated model.}

\subsection{Types of Splits}

\textcolor{blue}{Training, validation, test}

\textcolor{blue}{Common percentages -- depends on overall size}

\subsection{Sampling}

\textcolor{blue}{Random vs \textcolor{red}{stratified}}
