\chapter{Improving Generalizability}

\r{The methods shown in the upcoming sections aim to reduce overfitting, but at the cost of potentially limiting the ability of the model. That is, it is worth while avoiding these methods until you overfitting is certain \TD{ref section about determining overfitting}.}

\subsection{Parameter Regularization}

\r{Collection of techniques used to help generalize a model -- which may help prevent overfitting. Typically regularization penalizes complexity of a model.}



% TODO: figure of loss plot showing a steep training and shallow+divergent val/test loss

\r{Helps prevent the model from memorizing noise in the training data.}


\subsubsection{Why Regularization}

% TODO: index overfitting
\r{overfitting: a practical definition may include observing the training loss to improve while the validation loss degrades. \TD{possibly mention \\cite{Nakkiran2020DeepDD}}}

\r{Overfitting --- too complex --- Occam's razor --- hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is best}

\r{modification made to improve generalization.}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item Data --- Increase amount of data (even potentially artificially e.g. augmentation)
	\item Architecture --- Reduce complexity of model e.g. applying parameter constraints, and/or reduce overall number of parameters
\end{itemize}

% TODO: note about regularization --- the smaller the value, the stronger the regularization.

\paragraph{Elastic Net Regularization}

\subsection{Dataset Augmentation}

% NOTE: maybe I need to nest this?
\r{regularization technique}

\r{Arguably the best way to increase generalizability of a model is to train the model on more data. However, as readers may already be aware, this is not always easy. Collecting more data may not be time/cost effective, or even possible.}

\r{``free'' data in that the ``cost'' is minor computation}

\r{Please note, augmentation must be done responsibly. For example, if performing digit recognition, it would not be wise to perform rotational or flip transformations on the data since, depending on the specific data, a 6, rotated 180 or flipped vertically may now appear as a 9.}

\subsection{Dropout}

% TODO: explain dropout

\r{It is important to note that dropout is only present during training. i.e. dropout does not occur during test/evaluation if using dropout in the ``standard way''. However dropout is occassionally used for evaluation in attempt to quantify model uncertainty \TD{CITATION}}

\r{keeps a neuron active by a hyperparameterized probability.}

\r{Forces the network to learn mappings even in the absence of all the information.}

\r{one way to view this is to imagine dropout as a way to push units that are not only useful inthe presence of other units and prevent units from co-adopting one another.}

	\label{fig:regularization_dropout_overview_test}
\end{figure}

\r{some important notes about the implementation. The outputs at test time should be equivalent to their expected outputs at training time (which is altered due to the application of dropout).}

\r{One potential solution to this problem is to scale the outputs during inference in a way that compensates for the dropout probability.  For example, if the dropout rate was set to $0.5$, then it would become necessary to halve the neurons outputs at test time in order to keep the expected output the neurons have learned during training.  However, this may not be ideal in practice since it would require scaling all the neuron outputs at test time (where performance is often critical and more important).}

r{at test time, multiply the values by the expectation, not the on/off mask}

\r{dropout creates an ensemble of many networks (in a cheap way)}

\TD{create figure of this ensemble of many networks.}

\r{Another, perhaps more desirable solution, would be to use \IDI{inverted dropout}. This applies the same principal as outlined above, only the scaling occurs at training time rather that at test time. That is, during training, any neuron whose activation was not turned off, has the output divided by the dropout rate before being propagation to the next layer.  This way, at test time, no scaling is required.}

% TODO: find Breiman 1994 paper referenced in p249 of Deep Learning
\r{As described in \textcolor{red}{local ref} ensemble methods act as a form of regularization by combining several different models \TD{Breiman 1994}. This often improves generalizability since the included models will often make independent, different, errors on the data.}
