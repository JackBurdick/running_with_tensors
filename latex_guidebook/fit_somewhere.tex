% stats vs ML -- in ML you may keep outliers and build models for them. in ML outliers may be collapsed (capped) and in statistics they may be removed
% ML is used to learn the ``long tail'', make fine grained predictions, not just gobal averages

%% why try to stay in linear (like with feature crosses)
% NN with many layers are non-convex
% optimizing linear models is a convex problem (much easier)

% how have I not talked about transfer learning yet?
