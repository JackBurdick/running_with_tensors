% stats vs ML -- in ML you may keep outliers and build models for them. in ML outliers may be collapsed (capped) and in statistics they may be removed
% ML is used to learn the ``long tail'', make fine grained predictions, not just gobal averages

%% why try to stay in linear (like with feature crosses)
% NN with many layers are non-convex
% optimizing linear models is a convex problem (much easier)

% how have I not talked about transfer learning yet?

% optimizing is an NP-hard, non-convex optimization problem (coursera.need to double check)

\textcolor{blue}{Each layer in a DNN is a composition of the previous layer. i.e. if layer 1 = f(x), then layer 1 = g(f(x)), layer three is h(g(f(x)) \textcolor{green}{TODO: create diagram}}

\textcolor{blue}{SavedModel is the universal serializion format for TensorFlow models. SavedModel has support for multiple metagraphs -- this is important in serving where the model is slightly different than in training (removing dropout layers), and allows storage/access of models with tags. Supports SignatureDefs -- allows the specification of nodes as input/output (also supports multiple signatureDefs for multi-headed inference (see \textcolor{red}{local ref}))}


%%%% rough...
%\textcolor{red}{Multi-headed inference. Useful when using the same model for different tasks. e.g. using a model for one task, then later deciding to perform a similar task on the same data -- rather than train an entirely new model, the original model may be performing may of the same computations. }
