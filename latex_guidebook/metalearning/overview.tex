% quote fron Finn lecture 2
\r{``in some ways multi-task is a prereq for meta learning -- if you can't learn/solve the training tasks, you won't be able to learn new tasks''-- two ways to view meta-learning algorithms i) mechanistic view ii) probabilistic view.}

\r{use our experience from before in some way, that is learn parameters on some tasks such that we can use the learned parameters to solve new tasks}
