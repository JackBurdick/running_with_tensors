\subsection{Saver}

%%%% may belong in serving, may belong in Saver -- then ref other?
\textcolor{blue}{SavedModel is the universal serialization format for TensorFlow models. SavedModel has support for multiple metagraphs -- this is important in serving where the model is slightly different than in training (removing dropout layers), and allows storage/access of models with tags. Supports SignatureDefs -- allows the specification of nodes as input/output (also supports multiple signatureDefs for multi-headed inference (see \textcolor{red}{local ref}))}
