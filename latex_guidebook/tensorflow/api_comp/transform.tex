\subsection{Transform}

\subsubsection{Overview}

\textcolor{blue}{TensorFlow Transform is a library used for preprocessing data with TensorFlow.}

\textcolor{blue}{MOTIVE: calculating values (such as $\mu$ and $\sigma$) for an entire dataset can be challenging for large datasets.}

\textcolor{blue}{Though preprocessing can already be accomplished with standard python, numpy, other libraries, or even in TensorFlow, tf.Transform extends these capabilities to support full passes over the dataset.}
