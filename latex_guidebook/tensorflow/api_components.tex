\textcolor{green}{TODO: para about using metrics.}

\textcolor{green}{Para about using tensorboard during training and tfma after training}

\textcolor{blue}{Metrics computed during training (e.g. training and validation metrics) can be visualized in tensorboard. Tensorboard displays, and continuously updates during training, these metrics graphically against global training steps (or time) and is used to determine how well your model is being trained. TFMA computes and visualizes metrics from the final (presumably after training) model. These metrics are computed only once. \textcolor{red}{TFMA exports and computes the metrics once on a saved model which contains the eval graph and additional metadata}}

\textcolor{blue}{Where tensorboard will compare models to each other over time, TFMA will compare models at only one point in time. This is better displayed in \textcolor{red}{see figure xx}.}

\textcolor{green}{TODO: figure showing the difference between graphs from tensorboard and TFMA}
