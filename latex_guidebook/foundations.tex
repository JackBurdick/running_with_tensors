\chapter{Unsupervised}

\textcolor{blue}{Discovering hidden structures or patterns in unlabeled training data.}

% TODO: placement / may need to rename+restructure sections
\textcolor{blue}{unsupervised methods may be commonly used in two main settings:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data Exploration
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Visualization (clustering \textcolor{red}{local ref})
	\end{itemize}
	\item Preprocessing (e.g. prior to a supervised method)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compressing (dimensionality reduction \textcolor{red}{local ref})
		\item Creating new/different representations
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
