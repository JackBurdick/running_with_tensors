\section{What \& Why ML}
\textcolor{blue}{Arthur Samuel -- ``ML is the study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programed.''}

\textcolor{blue}{Tom Mitchel -- ``A program can be said to learn from experience `E' with respect to some class of tasks `T' and performance measure `P', if its performance at tasks in `T', as measured by `P', improves with experience `E'.''}

\textcolor{blue}{ML is everywhere.... everyday --- personalized music, show,book,product recommendations, automatic image tagging to specific tasks, detecting fraudulent credit card activity -- analyzing medical images (benign, or malignant). }
