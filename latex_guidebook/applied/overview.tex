\paragraph{Sequence to Sequence}

\subparagraph{Overview}


\r{Sequence to sequence models are typically associated with translation tasks.}

\r{stock prices --- a model may be given prices of a stock for a given number of days and the model will attempt to predict the prices shifted by a day in the future.}


\r{Encode to decode: Seq2Seq\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SutskeverVL14}}

\r{encode: compress information, in its entirety, to a fixed length vector that represents the information in it's entirety, commonly refered to as an ``embedding'' or, less frequently, a ``thought'' vector.}

\r{decode: transform the vector representation into the desired output.}

\subparagraph{advancements}


\r{sequence model $\rightarrow$ context vector $\rightarrow$ sequence model}

\TD{attention}
% TODO: will need to figure out how to organize these sections, also, it does not belong in the feedback file...
% but I do think these types of sections (``types of layers'' belong in single section.. architecture -> operations ?)

% original attention paper




\paragraph{Sequence to Vector}

\r{Sequence to vector models may be used to predict a vector associated with a time series}

\r{all outputs are typically ignored, except for the last one.}

\r{model may be given a sequence of text and attempt to predict a sentiment for a given sequence.}

\subparagraph{Overview}

\TD{todo}

\paragraph{Vector to Sequence}

\r{implementation --- model given a single value at the first timestep and (0s for the rest of the timesteps) and a sequence could be output.}

\r{may be sued in image captioning --- where an image is fed to a network in the first timestep and a sequence associated with that image may be output.}

\subparagraph{Overview}

\TD{todo}

\paragraph{Delayed Sequence to Sequence}

\r{Delayed sequence to sequence models are two step models, composed of an encoder and decoder. They are typically associated with translation tasks.  In this architecture, the encoder \textit{encodes} the sequence to a vector and the decoder \textit{decodes} the vector to a sequence.}

\r{This type of model may perform better than a standard sequence to sequence model for translation since the last word or part of a sequence may influence the overall meaning of the original input.}
