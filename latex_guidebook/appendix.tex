\section{Anomaly Detection}

\r{difficult to evaluate -- often onnly evaluated on ``known'' anomalies.}

\subsection{methods}

\subsubsection{PCA}

\TD{use of dimensionality methods \ALR to reduce the feature space and look for anomalous instances.}

\r{sometimes PCA is ``chained'' i.e. PCA may be performed on an already reduced dataset}

\r{reconstruction error largely depends on the number of components kept --- balance in the number of components to keep: too few and the original data may not be constructed well enough and if there are too many they all may be proproduced}

\r{sparse could also be }
