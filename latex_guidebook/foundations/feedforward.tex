\section{Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)}

\textcolor{blue}{Will be focusing on principals and basic feed forward networks}


\textcolor{blue}{A feedforward network can be represented as a directed acyclic graph -- a directed graph in which there exist no cycles in the underlying graph, with nodes representing neurons and connected by edges}

\textcolor{blue}{The most computationally expensive component is calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network}
