\section{Clustering}

\textcolor{blue}{Clustering, may be referred to as cluster analysis, involves grouping observations such that instances in the same group (cluster) are more similar to one another than they are to instances from another group --- where ``similarity'' is defined by `some metric'. Clustering may be used to explore a dataset}
