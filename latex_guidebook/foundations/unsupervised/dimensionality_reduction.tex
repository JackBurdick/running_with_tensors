\section{Dimensionality Reduction}

\textcolor{green}{todo: Overview}

\textcolor{blue}{Dimensionality reduction is typically used to reduce the dimensions in a feature representation while retaining as much information as possible.}

\textcolor{blue}{Motivation: i) mitigate issues caused by the curse of dimensionality ii) compress data iii) improve interpretability -- interpreting data in high dimensions is harder than in lower dimension spaces (particularly three or less) }
