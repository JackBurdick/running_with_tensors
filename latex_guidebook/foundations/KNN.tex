\section{K-Nearest Neighbors}

\textcolor{blue}{KNN is a lazy learner\index{lazy learner} (a special case of instance-based nonparametric model (see \textcolor{red}{local ref?})): the model memorizes the training dataset rather than learn a discriminative function}

\textcolor{blue}{KNN classification involves i) choosing the number of $k$ (nearest neighbors) and a distance metric, ii) finding the $k$ nearest neighbors, and iii) assigning a class label by majority vote.}

\textcolor{blue}{The optimal value for $k$ will greatly influence the bias-variance trade-off}
