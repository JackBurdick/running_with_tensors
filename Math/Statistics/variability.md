## Estimates of Variability

## Terms
- Deviations (errors, residuals)
> The difference between the observed and estimate.  The deviation tells us how dispersed the data is from the central value.
- Variance
> "The sum of the squared deviations from the mean divided by `n-1` (n: number of data values)"[1]
- Standard Deviation (l2-norm, Euclidean norm)
> The square root of the variance
- Mean absolute deviation (l1-norm, Manhattan norm)
> The mean of the absolute value of the deviations from the median
- Median absolute deviation from the median
> The median of the absolute value of the deviations from the median
- Range
> The difference between the largest and smallest value in a dataset
- Order statistics (ranks)
> Metrics based on the data values sorted from smallest to biggest
- Percentile (quantile)
> The value such that the indicated percentage of values take on the indicated value or less
- Interquartile range
> The difference between the 75th and 25th percentile
