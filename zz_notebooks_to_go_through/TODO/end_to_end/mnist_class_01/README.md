# MNIST Classification using sklearn
Exploring the MNIST dataset using sklearn.
![images of 3 and 5 from MNIST][image_output]

This image shows how the `SGDClassifier` gets makes mistakes trying to classify 3 and 5.  The left column are digits classified as 3s and the right column are digits classified as 5s. The upper left shows 3s correctly classified and the lower right shows 5s correctly classified.

## Project Information
The included [`./mnist_classifier_with_sklearn.ipynb`](https://github.com/JackBurdick/MNIST_sklearn_classification/blob/master/mnist_classifier_with_sklearn.ipynb) provides a commented walk though of using and evaluating our models in sklearn.

## Future Improvements:
1. The main `.ipynb` needs to be cleaned up and comments need to be improved.
2. Two cells still need to be run again to save the output to github.
